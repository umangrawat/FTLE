CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:36 (FIND_PACKAGE):
  By not providing "FindParaView.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "ParaView",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ParaView" with any
  of the following names:

    ParaViewConfig.cmake
    paraview-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ParaView" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ParaView_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ParaView" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
